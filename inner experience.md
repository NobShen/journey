The so-called inner experience

What is the inner experience and why is it so difficult to study?

- Inner experience is your subjective experience which means only you can experience it.  
- It is by nature subjective and no one else but you can confirm whether the experience happened or not.

The study of the brain confirms the function of each region of the brain.
- The prefrontal cortex is where your thinking takes place
- The reptilian brain controls your basic inate behavior

But none of the regions can be identified as where consciousness happens, until now.

And it happens by changing our way of thinking about consciousness - the inner experience.

According to Mark Soms, the inner experience doesn't belong to the prefrontal cortex.  It's actually in the reptilian region where feeling happens.

After all, an inner experience is just another name for feeling.

You may have many different kinds of feelings, but all boils down to like, hate, and neutral.

And these basic feelings have been with you all along, from even when you're just a single cell.  It is there to help you navigate your environment.

Suppose you're just a single cell, and all you could do was to move about so that you can look for food.  You haven't developed your sense of seeing, hearing, speaking, etc...

But you could move, and moving requires touching, so you had a sense of touch in order to move about.

As your sense of touch developed further, you can touch your way around so you can find something soft to suck its energy.

Then you developed your sense of touch further to know something is hot or cold as they may not be good when you suck it into your stomach - your inner cell.

And if you devoured something you thought was good but it was toxic to you, you learned how to vomit it out quickly to maintain your inner equilibrium.

If your inner equilibrium is way off, you will not behave coherrently.  You may even die.

So this inner compass helps you maintains your inner equilibrium to the best it should be.  And it only knows good, bad, neutral.

Neutral is when you eat something not so good and not so bad.  It doesn't give you more energy nor does it weakens you.

That commpass my friend is your inner experience.  No other cell knows what happens inside you.

And that inner experience in time evolves into your consciousness.
