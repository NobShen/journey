# How does reincarnation work?
- Theravada Buddhism believes reincarnation happens immediately
- Tibetan Buddhism believes there is a bardo - time between death and rebirth
- Both Theravada and Tibetan Buddism believe in the form- and formless realms
- The form-realm includes human and animal
- The formless-realm includes god and ghost
- When you're in the bardo (Tibetan) you're in the formless realm
- In this realm, you're there for a short time or a long time - but maximum is 7 weeks (Tibetan)
- But the Buddha taught that in the god realm, you could be there for many eons
- In real life, we hear that some meditators pass into the formless realm during meditation
- The reason we know this is because their bodies do not deteriorate
- And it's not known how long they stay in this state but some of them stay for many years already (*)
- So if we consider the Tibetan view of bardo, we can consider it as the ghost realm
- And consequently in the meditation state, the god realm
- And so if you're an Arahant then you don't go through the bardo nor the meditative state - you are in Nibbana
- You're in the ghost realm because you're still hungry to find a new body - you're a hungry ghost
- You're in the god realm because you're enjoying the perfect peace of the meditative state
- In both realms, when your time is up, you'll take the next birth
- And the gods emerge from perfect peace into one of the lower 5 realms - back into the dukkha
- And the ghosts emerge into human or animal realms
- With this logic, the longer you stay in the bardo, the longer you're in the ghost realm
