Is the physical universe independent from us, or is it created by our minds?
Does life create the universe instead of the other way around?
Does the moon exist if no one is looking?

Counter arguments:
- Something is created (by us) doesn't imply that it can't be independent from us.  Your children are independent from you.
- A blind man still falls off a cliff if he doesn't see it.
- Creation and independence are unrelated.
- Creations usually usurp the creator to take reign.  That's what happen in nature.  
- 
Let's examine closely.
- Does the world come into being from a thought?  OR
- Does the world evolve from unconsciousness to consciousness?

The scientific model of the world is that physics come first, then chemistry, then biology.
Physics and chemistry have no notion of consciousness, only biology has consciousness.
Consciousness is the consequence of having a brain.

What is a thought?  How is a thought produced?

Is everything just a manifestation of energy?
OR
Is everything just a manifestation of the mind?

The current thinking is the universe comes into being from the Big Bang.
- Let's remember the Big Bang is only the observable universe.  It may not be the entire universe.
- The Big Bang creates space and time.
- The first 2 elements were created right after the Big Bang (Hydrogen and Helium).

In nature, children kill parents to take reign.
Even if the universe is created by us, it can still be independent from us.

Biocentrism vs physicalism?

What is at the lowest substrate of reality?


The lowest substrate of existence is energy - undifferentiated and primordial
Dean Radin thinks consciousness is the lowest substrate
"The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence."
Nikola Tesla, Inventor and Futurist
It is because we are flesh-and-blood living machines that our experiences of the world and of “self” arise.
Which one is correct?  I'll believe it when I see it OR I'll see it when I believe it.
