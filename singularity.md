What is the Singularity?

In Physics, Einstein's Theory of General Relativity predicted the existence of black holes.  In essence, the theory predicted that any start byond a certain mass would exert a gravitational force so strong that it would collapse upon itself.  All matter is squeezed into a tiny space.  Even light can not get out. 

As light can not get out, the laws of Physics also collapse.  

This point where the laws of Physics collapse is the Singularity.  We're heading there.
