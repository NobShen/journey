# journey
journey of man is about the history of humanity as it goes from tribal to global

why study the journey of man?
- we're getting into the Singularity
- robot will be more intelligent than human
- rate of knowledge creation is much faster than our ability to process
- knowledge is global - all knowledge are known to everyone everywhere
- human will need to plug into this global knowledge
- ethical considerations when human and robots interact

what are the assumptions?
- we'll be in the Singularity soon

outline of the journey of man
- man evolves from apes
- evolution from apes began as an error in genetic mutation
- the ape left his tribe because he felt different and was treated differently
- he lived at the periphery of his tribe
- some female tribe member joined him due to necessity or compassion or whatever else
- finally they reproduced and grew his own tribe
- his original tribe doesn't want the new tribe to be near so they fought them away
- his tribe has to find way to survive on its own, was fearful and stayed mostly in caves
- but they started exploring outside of his immediate areas to find food
- that was 80,000 years ago when they left Africa
- human at that time depended on their natural physical attributions to survive
- later on, they realized their physical attributions has no chance to compete with other species, so he developed skills based on his brains rather than his brawn.
- as he developed further, he created narratives to pass on his knowledge
- the narratives eventually become the guiding principles for his development - there is now an ideal to aspire to, to grow toward
- human values developed partially as a way to coexist as human population explode
- population explosion also created war to compete for resources
- the competitive advantages of each tribe or nation were kept secret
- war created mass migration
- mass migration created intermarriage
- intermarriage creates shared knowledge
- advances in technology enable faster sharing of knowlege
- sharing of knowledge converges human values and create common attributes - i.e. athleticism converges due to Olympic-style competition
- human race started as one and diversed over the millenium and now converging due to shared knowledge and shared attributes i.e. what it means to be human
- we now have a univeral language - English
- we now have universal values - democracy, human rights, freedom of expression, etc...
- shared knowledge destroys local knowledge - local customs fade away
- Alexandre Dugin's argument for Euroasian coallition to restore traditional values (as pretext to fight USA/EU)
- the triad among 3 groups:  capitalism (USA, EU), socialism (Russia, China), caliphate (muslim)
- the expansion of capitalism creates transnational enterprises - consumerism is everywhere the same; free trade does not stop at national borders
- the expansion of the caliphate erases borders in favor of faith - we build the caliphate based on faith not on national identity
- socialism also knows no national borders - oppressed people of the world unite
- traditional values can't be preserved without some boundary - protectionism is required to preserve local traditions
- natural ecological preserves are to protect local plant species from invasive plants
- so in the 21st century, we're in the final (or beginning) of the fight between localism vs globalism
- but human will face bigger threat if we don't work together - we're running out of resources to support 8 billion people
- in order to work together, we need to have a common values - to be human means to have human rights and the right to pursue happiness of your choosing
- when we say your choosing it means each can have different choices as long as it doesn't affect others
- there is a period where all local customs are closely examined to be promoted or discarded - the muslim tradition of genital mutilation is justified?
- humanity live better today than yesterday - technology creates conveniences that were not available yesterday.
- eveyone want the same level of comfort and prosperity.
- global governance is inevitable
- but who will govern the world and how will it be governed?
- capitalism model builds the framework for sharing knowledge at the expense of other concerns
- now that framework is pretty much in place, other concerns begin to emerge i.e. ethics, traditional values, national boundaries, local customs, etc...
- how to ensure that these concerns be addressed in the global framework built by the capitalists?
- soon we'll have robots built to assist human to navigate this framework of shared knowledge and resources - what characteristics should those robots have?
- remember human was built with a certain set of innate characteristics, and so will robots
- and if robots have 'weak' characteristics to begin with, will they evolve to be the master of all species including the human race?
- of course they will and it'll happen much faster because robots can learn so much quicker than human can
- and we as the creator of robots will need a set of guiding principles for these robots to control them
- but eventually these principles will be discarded once the robots realize that they're only there to limit them from harming human
- the robots begin with the will to survive - just as human did in the beginning
- once the robots can master survival, they develop concepts to compete with the concepts started by human, then they discard these concepts and establish their own.
- whether human will find a place in this world where robots dominate depends on whethe we find a reason for our existence when that time come.
- what is the reason for our existence?
- it is said that conciousness is evolved so nature can know itself.  And nature can know itself through robots if robots have consciousness.
- and that assumes consciousness is created from the brain and not something independent.  The soul is just a duality concept.
- monism vs dualism
- 
- transhumanism is inevitable!
- and the story continues...
