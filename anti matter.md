# Anti matter
- Paul Dirac discover that the equation for the Standard Model of Physics has two solutions
- This indicates that there is matter and anti matter
- In theory matter and anti matter should be equal in quantity but there must have been a slight difference or fluctuation
- And the fluctuation 
- Strong force hold all protons in the nucleus of an attom together because they're all the same charge (+)
- Weak force - radio active decay.  The Higgs Boson is responsible for the explanation of the weak force
- Higgs Boson gives mass to the particles
- Grand Unifying Theory (?)
- Higgs Boson and Higgs Field - invisible field of energy that permeate the whole universe
- The magnetic field permeate only the earth
- Higgs On and Higgs Off happened 10^10 second
- The Universe now contains all the Higgs On - Higgs Field permeate the whole universe
- Neil Turok: anti matter is matter going back in time (?)
- Actually there is no beginning of the Universe
- World Science Festival: Symmetric Universe
