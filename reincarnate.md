# Does Buddhism believe in reincarnation?
- Yes, the Dhamapada (Kinh Phap Cu) tells the many lives of Buddha
- Yes, in Buddha's night of enlightenment, he saw all his previous lives
- So the concept of no-self doesn't apply to reincarnation
- No-self only means you have no control of things - nothing belongs to the Self
- The Self is only a set of things that come together that you call a Self
- The Self has no control when things come and go - Annica (arising and passing)
- Annica means things arise and pass on their own - Annata means you have no control over things
- And therefore Annata means no-self
