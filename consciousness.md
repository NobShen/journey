# Does consciousness precede matter?

According to the black hole theory, the Universe began with a Big Bang.
- Matter began to develop, first with elementary particles
- Then quarks, neutrinos, gluons, netron, atoms, molecules
- Then cells, organisms, plants and animals including human
- With plants and animals, consciousness developed
- With consciousness comes intelligence, civilizations, technologies, etc...

But did consciousness only begin with plants and animals?  It depends on what we mean by consciousness.

In a nutshell, consciousness is the basic awareness that an organism has to protect itself as it navigates its environment.  
As such, it might not be far fetch to say not only organisms but cells, molecules, atoms, neutrons, gluons, quarks, might also have consciousness.

Then the next question is which comes first?  Consciousness or elementary particles?

Or for that matter, even the Big Bang...

Buddhism posits 3 realms:  the desire realm, the form realm, and the formless realm.
The desire realm is dominated by desire.
The form realm is devoid of desire.
The formless realm is devoid of form.

From a science standpoint, the desire form corresponds to the biology world.
The form realm corresponds to the chemistry world.
The formless realm corresponds to the world of atoms, quarks, neutrinos, etc...  The formlesss realm is the fabric for the form realm.  And the form realm for the desire realm.
From an evolution standpoint, life goes from atoms to molecules then to cells and organs.
But from a spiritual stanpoint, according to Buddhism, is the evolution of consciousness, but it is away from the desire realm to the form and formless realms.  Why?
