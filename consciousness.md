Does consciousness precedes materials?

According to the black hole theory, the Universe began with a Big Bang.
- Elementary particles soon developed
- Then quarks, neutrinos, gluons, netron, atoms, molecules
- Then cells, organisms, plants and animals including human
- With plants and animals, consciousness developed
- With consciousness comes intelligence, civilizations, technologies, etc...

But did consciousness only began with plants and animals?  It depends on what we mean by consciousness.

In a nutshell, consciousness is the basic awareness that an organism has to protect itself as it navigates its environment.  
As such, it might not be far fetch to say not only organisms but cells, molecules, atoms, neutrons, gluons, quarks, might also have consciousness.

Then the next question is which comes first?  Consciousness or elementary particles?
