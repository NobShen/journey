# Does consciousness precede matter?

According to the black hole theory, the Universe began with a Big Bang.
- Matter began to develop, first with elementary particles
- Then quarks, neutrinos, gluons, netron, atoms, molecules
- Then cells, organisms, plants and animals including human
- With plants and animals, consciousness developed
- With consciousness comes intelligence, civilizations, technologies, etc...

But did consciousness only begin with plants and animals?  It depends on what we mean by consciousness.

In a nutshell, consciousness is the basic awareness that an organism has to protect itself as it navigates its environment.  
As such, it might not be far fetch to say not only organisms but cells, molecules, atoms, neutrons, gluons, quarks, might also have consciousness.

Then the next question is which comes first?  Consciousness or elementary particles?

Or for that matter, even the Big Bang...
